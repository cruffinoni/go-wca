# CHANGELOG

## develop

## v0.2.0

- Support IMMNotificationClient registration.
- Add `_example/DeviceEvents`.
- Change project layout.
- Use go.mod to manage dependencies.
- Rename `.go` files.

The golang convention doesn't allow the capitalized file name (e.g. `IMMNotificationClient.go`). However, the lower-cased file name (e.g. `immnotificationclient.go`) is very hard to read, I decided to break the convention.

## 0.1.0

Initial version
